This is a compilation of notes from my study of survey design and analysis. I completed Data Camp courses [Survey and Measurement Development in R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/survey-and-measurement-development-in-r) and [Analyzing Survey Data in R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/analyzing-survey-data-in-r), then moved on to Thomas Lumley's [Complex Surveys: a guide to analysis using R](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/svybook/)
