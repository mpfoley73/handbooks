# Preface {-}

This is a compilation of notes from my study of survey design and analysis. I completed Data Camp courses [Survey and Measurement Development in R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/survey-and-measurement-development-in-r) [@mount] and [Analyzing Survey Data in R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/analyzing-survey-data-in-r) [@mcconville], then moved on to Thomas Lumley's [Complex Surveys: a guide to analysis using R](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/svybook/) [@lumley2010].

## The **survey** Package {-}

Only simple random sample survey designs can be analyzed with with normal statistical test functions. Complex survey designs require special treatment. The **survey** package, developed by Thomas Lumley, handles both simple and complex survey designs. To analyze data using the **survey** package, create a **survey** object that wraps the survey data with its metadata.

The **survey** package contains a few data sets that will serve as examples in these notes.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(survey)

data(api, package = "survey")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
