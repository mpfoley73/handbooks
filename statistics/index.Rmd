# Preface {-}

These are notes from books, classes, tutorials, vignettes, etc. They contain mistakes, are poorly organized, and are sloppy on fundamentals. They should improve over time, but that's all I can say for it. *Use at your own risk.*

The focus of this handbook is statistical inference, including population estimates, group comparisons, and regression modeling. Not included here: probability, machine learning, text mining, survey analysis, or survival analysis. These subjects frequently arise at work, but are distinct enough and large enough to warrant separate handbooks.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.height = 3.5)
```
