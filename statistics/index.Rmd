# Introduction {-}

These notes mostly self-education from books, online classes, tutorials, vignettes, etc. They probably have a lot of mistakes, are poorly organized, and shaky on fundamentals. I hope over time this document grows and improves in quality along with my own mastery of data analysis, but that's all I can say for it. *If you found this from an internet search, use at your own risk!*

The focus of this handbook is statistical inference, including population estimates, group comparisons, and regression modeling. Not included in this handbook is foundational knowledge of probability and statistics, machine learning, text mining, survey analysis, or survival analysis. All these subjects frequently arise at work, but seem distinct and large enough to warrant separate handbooks.
