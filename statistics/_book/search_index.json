[["inference.html", "Chapter 1 Inference 1.1 P-Values 1.2 Example one 1.3 Example two", " Chapter 1 Inference Statistical inference is the use of a sample distribution to describe the population distribution. Hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and effect size estimates are all examples of statistical inference. We wary of published study results. Identical studies might produce both significant and non-significant results, yet it is likely that only the significant result reaches publication (publication bias). The researchers has flexibility in the data analysis methods and may have tortured the data until they found statistically significant result. Studies often suffer from low statistical power. Applying principles of inference can mitigate these problems. There are different approaches to establishing statistical inference. The path of action rejects a null hypothesis using Neyman-Pearson p-values on the basis that, in the long run, the rejection is probably correct. The path of knowledge compares the observed data to the likelihoods of the various hypothesized realities. The path of belief uses uses a observed data to update the prior belief. 1.1 P-Values P-values express how surprising the data is given the null hypothesis (H0). It says nothing about the probability that the hypothesis is true. For that, you need Bayesian statistics. Never draw a conclusion about the theory based on a p-value (p &lt; .05, so our theory). Instead, draw a conclusion about how the data relates to the theory (p &lt; .05, so our data is compatible with the theory). The inference made from a hypothesis test has four possible outcomes. You can correctly reject H0 (a true negative conclusion) or incorrectly reject H0 (a false negative). You can correctly accept H1 (true positive) or incorrectly accept H1 (false negative). \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are statistical thresholds that characterize the probabilities. H0 True H1 True Significant Finding False Positive (\\(\\alpha\\)) True Positive (1 - \\(\\beta\\)) Non-Significant Finding True Negative (1 - \\(\\alpha\\)) False Negative (\\(\\beta\\)) \\(\\alpha\\) is a tolerance level for incorrectly rejecting H0 (Type I error). The population distribution has values at the extremes, so your extreme measurement may just be one of them. Rejecting H0 that \\(\\mu = \\mu_0\\) if p is less than \\(\\alpha\\) acknowledges that in the limit, drawing this conclusion would be wrong \\(\\alpha\\)*100 percent of the time. Type I errors reject H0 when they shouldnt. Its the probability of staking an innocent person. Alpha is the probability of a significant result when H0 is true (there is no true effect). It is the type I error rate. Type II errors fail to reject H0 when they should. Its the probability of refraining from staking an actual vampire. Beta is the probability of a non-significant result when H1 is true. It is the type II error rate. 1 - beta is the probability of a significant result when H1 is true. I.e,, its the probability of a true positive. \\(\\alpha\\) is the false positive rate. \\(\\beta\\) is the false negative rate. \\(1 - \\alpha\\) is the true negative rate \\(1 - \\beta\\) is the true positive rate H0 True H1 True sig False Positive (alpha) True Positive (1-beta) nonsig True Negative (1-alpha) False negative (beta) 1.2 Example one 1.3 Example two "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
