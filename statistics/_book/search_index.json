[["matrix-algebra.html", "Chapter 7 Matrix Algebra", " Chapter 7 Matrix Algebra This section is a primer on basic matrix algebra and its application to multivariate statistics.1 Matrix algebra treats data transposed to how it is actually stored. An \\(n\\)-row \\(\\times\\) \\(p\\)-column data set is represented in matrix \\(X\\) as \\(n\\) columns and \\(p\\) rows. Think of \\(X\\) as a column vector of variables with each variable represented by a row vector of observations. \\[ X_i = \\begin{pmatrix}X_{i1} \\\\ X_{i2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_{ip} \\end{pmatrix} \\] So \\(X_{ij}\\) refers to column \\(i\\) of row vector \\(j\\), opposite of how the data frame is organized. Notes are primarily from PSU STAT 505: Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis.↩︎ "],["central-tendancy-dispersion-ans-association.html", "7.1 Central Tendancy, Dispersion, ans Association", " 7.1 Central Tendancy, Dispersion, ans Association The mean of variable \\(j\\) is the average of row vector \\(X_j\\), \\(\\bar{x}_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_{ij}\\). It estimates the population mean, \\(\\mu_j = E(X_j)\\). Note that the means are a column vector of the variable means, \\[\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_1 \\\\ \\mu_2 \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ \\mu_p \\end{pmatrix}\\] The variance of variable \\(j\\) is the average squared difference from the mean for row vector \\(X_j\\), \\(s_j^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j)^2\\). It estimates the population variance, \\(\\sigma_j^2 = E(X_j - \\mu_j)^2\\). Again, the variances are represented as a column vector, \\[\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1^2 \\\\ \\sigma_2^2 \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ \\sigma_p^2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] The covariance of variables \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) population covariance is is the average product of differences from their respective means, \\(s_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j) (X_{ik} - \\bar{x}_k)\\). It estimates the population covariance, \\(\\sigma_{jk} = E\\{ (X_{ij} - \\mu_j) (X_{ik} - \\mu_k)\\}\\). It can be shown that the covariance is equivalently expressed as \\[ s_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^n X_{ij}X_{ik} - \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^n X_{ij} \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_{ik}}{n} \\right] \\] This is closer to how it is actually calculated. The first term is dot product \\(X_j \\cdot X_k\\). The second term is the product of the averages. You can generalize this across the entire set of variables as \\[ \\begin{align} S &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\bar{x}) (X_i - \\bar{x})&#39; \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i X_i^{&#39;} - \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i}{n} \\right] \\end{align} \\] Example File nutrient.txt is from PSU STAT 505. nutrient &lt;- readr::read_fwf( file = &quot;./input/nutrient.txt&quot;, col_positions = readr::fwf_widths( c(3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8), col_names = c(&quot;ID&quot;, &quot;Calcium&quot;, &quot;Iron&quot;, &quot;Protien&quot;, &quot;Vitamin A&quot;, &quot;Vitamin C&quot;) ), show_col_types = FALSE ) Here are the summary statistics. nutrient %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -ID) %&gt;% summarize(M = mean(value), SD = sd(value), .by = name) ## # A tibble: 5 × 3 ## name M SD ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Calcium 624. 397. ## 2 Iron 11.1 5.98 ## 3 Protien 65.8 30.6 ## 4 Vitamin A 840. 1634. ## 5 Vitamin C 78.9 73.6 X &lt;- nutrient %&gt;% select(-ID) %&gt;% as.matrix() %&gt;% t() 1 / nrow(nutrient) * (X %*% t(X) - rowSums(X) %*% t(rowSums(X)) / nrow(nutrient)) ## Calcium Iron Protien Vitamin A Vitamin C ## Calcium 157615.2927 938.81387 6067.5723 102272.170 6692.5229 ## Iron 938.8139 35.76195 113.9033 2379.920 137.4852 ## Protien 6067.5723 113.90327 933.6084 7320.106 476.5523 ## Vitamin A 102272.1699 2379.91983 7320.1057 2664831.675 22033.3120 ## Vitamin C 6692.5229 137.48519 476.5523 22033.312 5408.9150 https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat505/lesson/1/1.3 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
