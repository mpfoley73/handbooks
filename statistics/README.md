hese are notes from books, classes, tutorials, vignettes, etc. They contain mistakes, are poorly organized, and are sloppy on fundamentals. They should improve over time, but that's all I can say for it. *Use at your own risk.*

The focus of this handbook is statistical inference, including population estimates, group comparisons, and regression modeling. Not included here: probability, machine learning, text mining, survey analysis, or survival analysis. These subjects frequently arise at work, but are distinct enough and large enough to warrant separate handbooks.
