# Inference

Statistical inference is the use of sample data to describe the distribution of the population. Hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and effect size estimates are all examples of statistical inference. 

Published studies suffer from publication bias, flexibility in the data analysis methods (torturing the data), and low statistical power in the studies (*p*-values are a function of the power of the test and *n* sizes are often too low). Applying the principles of inference can mitigate these problems.

There is more than one approach to statistical inference. The **path of action** uses Neyman-Pearson *p*-values to decide whether to reject a null hypothesis, knowing in the long run your are usually right. The **path of knowledge** compares observed data to the likelihood of the various possible realities. The **path of belief** uses uses a observed data to update your prior belief.
